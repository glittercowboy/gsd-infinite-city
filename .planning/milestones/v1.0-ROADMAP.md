# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2025-12-15
**Phases:** 1-5 (plus 1.1 inserted)
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

Browser-based Three.js driving game with procedurally generated infinite city. Portfolio piece demonstrating procedural generation, real-time 3D graphics, and game AI running performantly in a browser.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Working Three.js scene with a driveable car
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Vite + TypeScript + Three.js with arcade driveable car

### Phase 1.1: Car Speed Increase (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Speed up the car significantly for better gameplay feel
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01.1-01: 3x car speed increase

### Phase 2: Procedural City

**Goal**: Infinite procedurally generated city with varied districts
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: ChunkManager with seeded RNG and dynamic chunk loading
- [x] 02-02: Grid-based road network with chunk boundary alignment
- [x] 02-03: InstancedMesh building system with squared height distribution
- [x] 02-04: District system with simplex noise and tree generation

### Phase 3: Driving & Collision

**Goal**: Arcade driving physics with collision detection
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Box3 collision with MTV separation and arcade bounce

### Phase 4: Traffic AI

**Goal**: Reactive traffic that populates roads and responds to player
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: InstancedMesh TrafficManager with lane-following AI cars
- [x] 04-02: Traffic AI collision avoidance and player reactions
- [x] 04-03: Traffic variety, intersection yielding, LOD optimization

### Phase 5: Visuals & Deploy

**Goal**: Polished visuals with day/night cycle, deployed to Vercel
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Day/night cycle with smooth transitions, deployed to Vercel

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 1.1: Car Speed Increase (inserted after Phase 1 for gameplay feel)

**Key Decisions:**
- TypeScript for type safety with complex game logic
- Arcade physics over realism for fun, forgiving controls
- Chunk-based generation for infinite exploration
- Reactive AI (brake-only avoidance) to balance complexity
- InstancedMesh for all repeated geometry (buildings, trees, cars)
- Simplex noise for district variation
- 2-minute day/night cycle for demo visibility

**Issues Resolved:**
- None - clean execution

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
