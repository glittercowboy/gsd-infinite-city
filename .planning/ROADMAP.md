# Roadmap: Procedural City Driving Game

## Overview

Build a browser-based Three.js driving game with procedurally generated infinite city. Start with foundation and basic movement, then layer procedural generation, physics, traffic AI, and visual polish to create an explorable open world.

## Domain Expertise

None (no Three.js/web game domain expertise available)

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Project setup, basic scene, car movement
- [x] **Phase 1.1: Car Speed Increase** - Speed up the car significantly
- [x] **Phase 2: Procedural City** - Chunk generation, buildings, roads, trees
- [x] **Phase 3: Driving & Collision** - Arcade physics, collision detection
- [x] **Phase 4: Traffic AI** - AI cars, path following, reactive behavior
- [ ] **Phase 5: Visuals & Deploy** - Day/night cycle, polish, Vercel deploy

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Working Three.js scene with a driveable car
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Unlikely (standard TypeScript/Three.js setup)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 1.1: Car Speed Increase
**Goal**: Speed up the car significantly for better gameplay feel
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (tuning existing physics values)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 2: Procedural City
**Goal**: Infinite procedurally generated city with varied districts
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Likely (procedural generation algorithms)
**Research topics**: Chunk-based world generation, procedural building placement, road network generation (WFC vs grid-based vs L-systems), district variation algorithms
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 3: Driving & Collision
**Goal**: Arcade driving physics with collision detection
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (established physics/collision patterns for Three.js)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: Traffic AI
**Goal**: Reactive traffic that populates roads and responds to player
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Likely (traffic AI implementation)
**Research topics**: Path following on road networks, vehicle avoidance algorithms, traffic light systems, performance with many AI agents
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 5: Visuals & Deploy
**Goal**: Polished visuals with day/night cycle, deployed to Vercel
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Research**: Unlikely (internal polish, standard deploy)
**Plans**: TBD
