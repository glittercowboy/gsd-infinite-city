# Roadmap: Procedural City Driving Game

## Milestones

- ✅ [v1.0 MVP](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) (Phases 1-5) — SHIPPED 2025-12-15
- 🚧 **v1.1 Polish & Gameplay** (Phases 6-11) — In Progress

## Overview

Build a browser-based Three.js driving game with procedurally generated infinite city. Start with foundation and basic movement, then layer procedural generation, physics, traffic AI, and visual polish to create an explorable open world.

## Domain Expertise

None (no Three.js/web game domain expertise available)

## 🚧 v1.1 Polish & Gameplay (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Transform the MVP into a polished, immersive driving experience with smooth curved vehicles, detailed buildings, atmospheric effects, and expanded environment variety.

### Phase 6: Quick Fixes + Atmosphere
**Goal**: Fix tree spawn padding, implement full celestial system (sun/moon with phases, stars, sunrise/sunset glow, directional lighting)
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: TBD

### Phase 7: Gameplay Feel
**Goal**: Add nitrous boost (shift key), subtle screen shake on collision, speed-based motion blur
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Research**: Unlikely (Three.js post-processing)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 07-01: TBD

### Phase 8: Vehicle Overhaul
**Goal**: Smooth curved car geometry, distinct traffic types (sedan/SUV/truck), wheels, headlights, functional brakelights
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Research**: Unlikely (geometry construction)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: TBD

### Phase 9: Traffic Intelligence
**Goal**: Traffic lights at intersections, AI stop/go behavior, player-traffic collision detection
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Research**: Unlikely (extends existing traffic system)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01: TBD

### Phase 10: Building Variety
**Goal**: Geometry windows with night emissive glow, procedural houses (porches/fences/parked cars, neighborhood grouping), distinct skyscrapers (glass/setbacks), shops (awnings/neon signs)
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Research**: Unlikely (procedural geometry patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: TBD

### Phase 11: Environment Expansion
**Goal**: Terrain elevation (hills/mountains), nature biomes (dense forests, manicured parks, wilderness with lakes), smooth urban-to-nature transitions
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Research**: Likely (terrain noise algorithms, biome transitions)
**Research topics**: Simplex noise for heightmaps, water rendering, LOD for terrain
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: TBD
