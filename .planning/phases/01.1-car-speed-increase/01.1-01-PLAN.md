<objective>
Significantly increase car speed for better gameplay feel.

Purpose: The car feels too slow - make it faster and more fun to drive around the city.
Output: Tuned physics values in car.ts resulting in noticeably faster car.

**Current values (from car.ts:50-52):**
- acceleration: 15
- maxSpeed: 20
- reverse speed: maxSpeed * 0.5 (10)

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Arcade physics (fun over realism) - supports aggressive speed increase
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Increase car speed and acceleration</name>
  <files>src/car.ts</files>
  <action>
    Increase the car physics values significantly:
    - maxSpeed: 20 → 60 (3x increase)
    - acceleration: 15 → 45 (3x increase to match)

    This maintains the same acceleration-to-max-speed ratio while making the car much faster.
    The reverse speed (maxSpeed * 0.5) will automatically scale to 30.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run dev`, drive the car around - should feel noticeably faster</verify>
  <done>Car accelerates to ~60 units/sec instead of 20, feels fast and fun</done>
</task>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] Car visibly accelerates faster
- [ ] Car reaches higher top speed
- [ ] Controls still feel responsive (not too twitchy)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Car speed increased ~3x
- No TypeScript errors
- Game still playable (not uncontrollably fast)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01.1-car-speed-increase/01.1-01-SUMMARY.md`
