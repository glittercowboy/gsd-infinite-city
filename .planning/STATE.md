# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Browser-based Three.js driving game with procedurally generated infinite city

**Core requirements:**
- Driveable procedural city that spawns as you explore
- Varied districts (downtown, suburbs, industrial, parks)
- Reactive traffic AI (avoid player, honk, basic awareness)
- Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting
- Playable frame rates (30+ FPS) on modern browsers

**Constraints:**
- Web-only (browser-based)
- Vercel/Netlify static hosting
- Performance critical (many objects on screen)

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Init | TypeScript | Type safety for complex game logic |
| Init | Arcade physics | Fun over realism, forgiving controls |
| Init | Chunk-based generation | Enables infinite exploration |
| Init | Reactive AI (not full sim) | Balance between simple and complex |
