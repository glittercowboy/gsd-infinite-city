# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Browser-based Three.js driving game with procedurally generated infinite city

**Core requirements:**
- Driveable procedural city that spawns as you explore
- Varied districts (downtown, suburbs, industrial, parks)
- Reactive traffic AI (avoid player, honk, basic awareness)
- Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting
- Playable frame rates (30+ FPS) on modern browsers

**Constraints:**
- Web-only (browser-based)
- Vercel/Netlify static hosting
- Performance critical (many objects on screen)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Procedural City)
Plan: 1 of ? in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2025-12-15 - Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ██░░░░░░░░ 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 16 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |
| 2. Procedural City | 1 | 12 min | 12 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4 min, 12 min
- Trend: Baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Init | TypeScript | Type safety for complex game logic |
| Init | Arcade physics | Fun over realism, forgiving controls |
| Init | Chunk-based generation | Enables infinite exploration |
| Init | Reactive AI (not full sim) | Balance between simple and complex |
| P1 | WeakMap for car physics state | Clean separation of mesh from physics data |
| P1 | Quaternion-based camera offset | Smooth following regardless of car rotation |
| P2 | Chunk size 64 units | Balance between granularity and draw calls |
| P2 | View distance 3, cache 5 | Hysteresis prevents chunk thrashing |
| P2 | Fog 100-300 units | Hides chunk edges without claustrophobia |
