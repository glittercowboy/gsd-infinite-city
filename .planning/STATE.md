# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Browser-based Three.js driving game with procedurally generated infinite city

**Core requirements:**
- Driveable procedural city that spawns as you explore
- Varied districts (downtown, suburbs, industrial, parks)
- Reactive traffic AI (avoid player, honk, basic awareness)
- Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting
- Playable frame rates (30+ FPS) on modern browsers

**Constraints:**
- Web-only (browser-based)
- Vercel/Netlify static hosting
- Performance critical (many objects on screen)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 4 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Init | TypeScript | Type safety for complex game logic |
| Init | Arcade physics | Fun over realism, forgiving controls |
| Init | Chunk-based generation | Enables infinite exploration |
| Init | Reactive AI (not full sim) | Balance between simple and complex |
| P1 | WeakMap for car physics state | Clean separation of mesh from physics data |
| P1 | Quaternion-based camera offset | Smooth following regardless of car rotation |
